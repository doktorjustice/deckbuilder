# Hearthstone Deckbuilder

My first project in AngularJS. Serves learning purposes and experimenting. The basic goal is to select cards for Hearthstone decks and get simple statistics and charts.

[Demo](https://hsdeck.firebaseapp.com/)

Uses [Angularfire](https://github.com/firebase/angularfire) and [Angular Google Charts](https://github.com/angular-google-chart/angular-google-chart). Card data comes from [Hearthstone API](http://hearthstoneapi.com/)

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.15.1.
