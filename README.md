# Hearthstone Deckbuilder

My first project in AngularJS. Serves learning purposes and experimenting. 

The app lets you search through available cards, compile Hearthstone decks and get simple statistics and charts about them.

[Demo on Firebase hosting](https://hsdeck.firebaseapp.com/)

Uses [Angularfire](https://github.com/firebase/angularfire) and [Angular Google Charts](https://github.com/angular-google-chart/angular-google-chart). Card data comes from [Hearthstone API](http://hearthstoneapi.com/)

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.15.1.
